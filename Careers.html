                <p> Software developers invent the technologies we sometimes take for granted. For instance, that app that rings, sings or buzzes you out of a deep sleep every morning?
                    A software developer helped design that. And when you roll into the office and turn on your computer, clicking and scrolling through social media, music and your personal
                    calendar – software developers had a big hand in shaping those, too.You might spend your lunch shopping, and before you make that big purchase, you check your bank account
                    balance using your phone. Later, you're cooking a new recipe from that great app your friend told you about. As you look over the course of your day, you come to see that
                    software developers are the masterminds behind the technologies you now can't imagine living without.The best software developers are creative and have the technical expertise to carry out

              <h2>Data scientist</h2>
                <p> Data scientists use technology to glean insights from large amounts of data they collect. It’s a field that requires statistics, quantitative reasoning and computer
                  programming skills. On top of all that, you need to be a good communicator so you can report your research findings and explain how they address a larger question you’re
                  trying to answer.“A data scientist really is a scientist at heart,” says Scott Beliveau, chief of the enterprise advanced analytics branch within the U.S. Patent and Trademark
                  Office's Office of the Chief Technology Officer. “But rather than using chemicals or other things, a data scientist uses data – numbers, zeros, sometimes it’s textual information – to try and solve and answer problems.”
                  to try and solve and answer problems.”While data science is still a new career field, employers are increasingly recognizing the value of professionals with this expertise.

                    <p> Computer and information systems managers, or information technology managers, are the guides who help organizations navigate the always-changing labyrinth that is
                modern technology. These all-important employees deliver short- and long-term visions for the company's technology needs and goals. Even though most IT managers have
                the technical chops to execute the various jobs of the workers they supervise,they are more likely to be caught in a meeting room than a server room.
                Coordinating technology-related matters with top executives, planning upgrades of existing software or hardware and negotiating with vendors for the service of current products or
                the purchase of new ones are all common tasks IT managers encounter. IT managers also install and upgrade an organization's computer system and protect the office network from hackers
                and malware.

              <h2>Information security analyst</h2>
            <p>Information security analysts are the gatekeepers or security guards of information systems. To explain it another way: These professionals plan and execute security measures to
               shield an organization's computer systems and networks from infiltration and cyberattacks.They prevent, monitor and respond to data breaches and cyberattacks, which are becoming more common.
               The Ashley Madison website was hacked in 2015, while Sony experienced a major attack in 2014, as did JPMorgan Chase & Co. And no one can forget all the shoppers compromised in Target's major
               data breach in 2013.Andrea Hoy, president of the Information Systems Security Association's international board of directors, was always interested in how things worked. As a child,
              she would take apart malfunctioning toys and piece them back together, sometimes successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully.
